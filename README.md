# [DevExplorations](https://blog.besson.co/)

My personal blog. Forked from [Overreacted](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io) by Dan Abramov who forked it from [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). Syntax theme based on [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/) with small tweaks.

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn dev`, then open https://localhost:8000.
